## Key Features Working

1. **First-Time Visitors:** Must verify age before accessing site
2. **Returning Visitors:** Verification persists for 30 days
3. **Age Validation:** Properly calculates age and enforces 21+ requirement
4. **Error Handling:** Clear error messages for invalid dates or underage users
5. **Mobile Support:** Works on all mobile browsers with fallback storage
6. **Private Browsing:** Degrades gracefully with warnings
7. **Grand Opening:** Shows only after age verification

## Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Private Browsing Mode
- **Impact:** Storage may not persist
- **Solution:** System shows warning banner and falls back to session/memory storage

### Issue 2: Storage Quota Exceeded
- **Impact:** Can't save verification
- **Solution:** Falls back through storage layers (localStorage → IndexedDB → sessionStorage → memory)

### Issue 3: JavaScript Disabled
- **Impact:** Site won't function
- **Solution:** This is expected - cannabis sites require JS for age verification

## Recommendations

1. **Current Status:** System is working as designed - NO CHANGES NEEDED
2. **Monitoring:** Check browser console for storage info in debug mode
3. **Testing:** Use the provided test script to verify functionality
4. **User Experience:** Consider analytics to track verification success rates

The age verification system is **fully functional and properly integrated**. It successfully:
- Prevents underage access
