# Legal Compliance Audit Report - The Library Dispensary
## Cannabis Website Wellness Terminology Analysis

**Date:** January 27, 2025
**Auditor:** Legal Compliance Scanner
**Website:** thelibrarynj.com
**Verdict:** **BLOCK - CRITICAL COMPLIANCE VIOLATIONS**

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The website has implemented a dual-presentation strategy using "wellness" terminology for Google crawlers while displaying cannabis-specific content to regular users. This adaptive content strategy creates significant legal compliance risks under New Jersey cannabis regulations and federal advertising laws.

### Critical Findings
- **NJ License Display:** No visible cannabis license number displayed
- **Deceptive Marketing:** Adaptive content violates FTC truth-in-advertising requirements
- **Age Verification:** Compliant session-based system (21+)
- **FDA Disclaimers:** Present but incomplete
- **Privacy Policy:** GDPR/CCPA compliant with proper consent mechanisms
- **Cookie Consent:** Properly implemented with opt-in/opt-out

---

## DETAILED COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS

### 1. NEW JERSEY STATE CANNABIS REGULATIONS

#### A) License Display Requirements ❌ **VIOLATION**
**Requirement:** N.J.A.C. 17:30-9.8 requires cannabis license number to be prominently displayed
**Finding:** No license number found in codebase or displayed on website
**Risk Level:** **CRITICAL**
**Fix Required:**
```jsx
// Add to Footer.tsx after line 25
<p className="text-library-white/80 text-sm">
  NJ Cannabis License: [INSERT_LICENSE_NUMBER]
</p>
```

#### B) Age Verification (21+) ✅ **COMPLIANT**
- Session-based age gate properly implemented
- Requires date of birth entry
- Blocks access until verification
- Clear 21+ messaging throughout

#### C) Product Terminology ⚠️ **HIGH RISK**
**Issue:** Adaptive content showing "wellness products" to Google but "cannabis" to users
**Legal Risk:** Violates N.J.A.C. 17:30-10.1 requiring accurate product representation
**Code Evidence (GoogleOptimizedHero.tsx):**
```jsx
// Lines 81-91: Shows "Information Center" to Google
// Lines 92-103: Shows "Cannabis Dispensary" to regular users
```

### 2. FDA COMPLIANCE

#### A) Health Disclaimers ⚠️ **PARTIAL COMPLIANCE**
**Present Disclaimers:**
- "Not FDA approved" ✅
- "Limited side effects information" ✅
- "May be health risks" ✅

**Missing Requirements:**
- Specific warning about drug interactions
- Statement that products are not intended to diagnose/treat/cure disease

**Fix Required:**
```jsx
// Add to Footer.tsx line 155
<p className="text-xs text-library-white/60 pt-2">
  These statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.
  Cannabis products are not intended to diagnose, treat,
  cure, or prevent any disease. May interact with other medications.
</p>
```

### 3. FTC TRUTH IN ADVERTISING

#### ❌ **CRITICAL VIOLATION: Deceptive Marketing Practices**
**Issue:** Website serves different content based on user agent detection
**Evidence:**
- `lib/googleOptimization.ts` contains user agent detection
- Content changes from "cannabis" to "wellness" for Google crawlers
- Misleads search engines about actual business nature

**Legal Risk:** Violates 15 U.S.C. §45 (FTC Act) - Unfair or Deceptive Acts
**Potential Penalties:** Up to $46,517 per violation

### 4. ADVERTISING RESTRICTIONS

#### A) No On-Site Consumption ✅ **COMPLIANT**
- Clear warnings present in footer
- FAQ section properly states no on-site consumption

#### B) Medical vs Recreational Claims ⚠️ **RISK**
**Issue:** Wellness terminology could imply medical benefits
**Risk:** May violate N.J.S.A. 24:6I-7 prohibiting unsubstantiated health claims

### 5. PRIVACY & DATA PROTECTION

#### A) CCPA/GDPR Compliance ✅ **COMPLIANT**
- Comprehensive privacy policy
- Rights clearly stated (access, deletion, portability)
- Contact information provided
- Cookie consent properly implemented

#### B) COPPA (Children's Protection) ✅ **COMPLIANT**
- 21+ age gate prevents under-13 access
- No content targeted at children

#### C) Cookie Consent ✅ **COMPLIANT**
- Prior consent for non-essential cookies
- Granular control (necessary vs analytics)
- Easy withdrawal mechanism
- GDPR/CCPA compliant notice

### 6. INDEXING & SEO CONTROLS

#### Robots.txt Analysis ⚠️ **CONFIGURATION ISSUE**
**Finding:** Full access granted to all crawlers
```txt
User-agent: Googlebot
Allow: /
```
**Issue:** Allows indexing of potentially non-compliant adaptive content

#### Sitemap ✅ **PRESENT**
- Located at `/public/sitemap.xml`
- Properly formatted

### 7. OPEN-SOURCE LICENSING

#### SBOM Analysis
**Dependencies Found:** 26 packages
**License Compliance:**
- All dependencies use MIT or ISC licenses ✅
- No copyleft obligations
- No attribution files required

## LEGAL RISK ASSESSMENT

### Risk Matrix
| Issue | Severity | Likelihood | Impact |
|-------|----------|------------|---------|

| Incomplete FDA disclaimers | MEDIUM | Medium | Warning letter |

### Estimated Legal Exposure
- **NJ Cannabis Violations:** $5,000 - $25,000 per violation
- **FTC Deceptive Practices:** Up to $46,517 per violation
- **FDA Violations:** Warning letter to $10,000 fines
- **Total Potential Exposure:** $61,517 - $100,000+

---

## CONCLUSION

The website's attempt to use "wellness" terminology for SEO purposes while maintaining cannabis content for users creates unacceptable legal risks. This dual-presentation strategy violates:

1. **NJ cannabis advertising regulations** requiring accurate representation
2. **FTC truth-in-advertising laws** prohibiting deceptive practices
3. **Google's webmaster guidelines** against cloaking

**RECOMMENDATION:** Immediately cease using adaptive content. Choose one consistent terminology approach - either fully embrace cannabis dispensary identity OR pivot to CBD/hemp products that can legally use wellness terminology.

The current hybrid approach is legally untenable and exposes the business to regulatory action, fines, and potential license revocation.
